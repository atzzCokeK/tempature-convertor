# What I thought to develop this app

# Language
I selected Typescript to develop. I am sure that typed programming is very useful and better at any scale, even if an app is small.
In my experience, I mainly used Elm which is pure-functional programming language.

# How I implement light/dark mode
- I make the custome hook(useDaekMode.ts) to handle the state(light or dark).
- I use localstorage to read when this app is initialized, and also set the current state when it's toggled.
